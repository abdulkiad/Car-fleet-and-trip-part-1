The following program takes in two files Trips and Cars and both have different characteristics.
my code takes in the litres of a car and km per litres it can travel and calculates the range of the code.
it then checks the trip distance and sees what car has the range to do it.
 (in doing this i simply sorted the trip distance and ranges and matched them)
 so the end product would be the trip which suits the car the most.
 it took me a while to find a way to pair them both together.
 i had few ideas and experimented so many times but in the end came up with this conclusion.
 i also was using the shop as a template and was not comfortable with the to_s function
